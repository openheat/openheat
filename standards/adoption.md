## How to Adopt These Standards

Open Heat standards are intentionally flexible and may be adopted in a variety of ways.

You may choose to:
- Adopt a standard as written
- Adapt it to reflect local context or community needs
- Use it as a foundation for your own policies or guidelines
- Translate it into other languages

When adopting or adapting an Open Heat standard:
- Clearly attribute the original standard
- Indicate whether changes have been made
- Apply it in a way consistent with its values based intent

Adoption of an Open Heat standard does not imply endorsement, affiliation, or governance by the Open Heat Initiative or any other organization.
