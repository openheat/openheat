# Open Heat Community Code

A shared foundation of values for the global spicy community.

The Open Heat Community Code is a values based framework intended to support respectful, inclusive, and collaborative communities across the global spicy world.

This Code is not a rulebook.  
It is a foundation for culture.

---

## 1. Equal Standing

No individual, group, or organization holds inherent authority over others by default.

Communities of all sizes and backgrounds deserve equal respect and consideration.

---

## 2. Respect as a Baseline

Passion is central to the spicy world.  
Respect is what allows that passion to exist without harm.

Differences in style, tradition, rules, and philosophy are expected and valuable. Respect enables those differences to coexist productively.

---

## 3. Strength Without Harm

Intensity, competition, and bold expression are part of spicy culture.

They do not justify:
- personal attacks
- dogpiling or collective harassment
- public shaming
- coordinated retaliation
- attempts to silence or overwhelm others

Strength should inspire and challenge, not intimidate, isolate, or suppress participation.

---

## 4. Focus on Ideas, Not Individuals

Disagreement is a natural and healthy part of growth.

Discussion should remain focused on ideas, practices, and outcomes, not on the character, identity, or worth of the people expressing them.

---

## 5. Diversity as an Asset

The global spicy community spans cultures, regions, and traditions.

This diversity strengthens the community when multiple perspectives are able to participate without exclusion, domination, or dismissal.

---

## 6. Communities Exist to Connect

Community spaces exist to enable connection, collaboration, and shared enthusiasm.

Conflict may occur, but communities are healthiest when connection, learning, and celebration remain the priority rather than division or escalation.

---

## 7. Accountability with Purpose

Accountability supports long term community health.

Its purpose is to protect individuals, preserve constructive participation, and uphold fairness.

Accountability is not public spectacle or collective punishment.  
It exists to support trust and healthy participation over time.

---

## 8. Shared Responsibility

Culture is shaped by participation.

Every interaction contributes to the environment a community creates. Adopting this Code represents a shared commitment to maintaining a respectful and constructive space.

---

## Closing

The Open Heat Community Code expresses a shared aspiration for how spicy communities interact and grow together.

This Code belongs to everyone who chooses to adopt it.
